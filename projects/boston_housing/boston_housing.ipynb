You will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions for this project. Unless it is requested, do not modify any of the code that has already been included. In this template code, there are four sections which you must complete to successfully produce a prediction with your model. Each section where you will write code is preceded by a **STEP X** header with comments describing what must be done. Please read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "# Analyzing Model Performance\n",
    "In this third section of the project, you'll take a look at several models' learning and testing error rates on various subsets of training data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing `max_depth` parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects learning and testing errors. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone."

    "\n",
    "The training set error is small with fewer data points because the underlying relationship expressed by the model is not complex.  There are often many simple models that can express a relatioship between a few data points with low error.  A simple model trained on a few data points does not generalize well to other data.  This is why the testing set error is large with fewer data points.  \n",

    "If there is a true model, and we have infinite data to train it, we should be able to minimize the training and testing error to 0.  There would be no bias or variance in the model.  While I have no mathematical proof to back this up, we live in a world where there will always be a tradeoff between bias and variance because we only have access to finite data."

    "The selling price of the clients home is  216,300 dollars.  However, this seems to change slightly every time I run the code because of randomness in the way the alogrithm splits the data into training and testing sets.  Running the code 100 times with different variations of the train-test split gives a median selling price of about 210,000 dollars.  The selling price is below the mean and the median housing prices in Boston.  The selling price falls within one standard deviation of the mean selling price.\n",

    "**Answer: ** I would not use this model to predict the selling price of a client's home in Boston.  I would try to gather much more data than the 506 training examples in this data set. This would allow the model to better generalize to unseen data.  I would also want to explore the variability in the trained parameters given by the GridSearchCV function.  With more data, I introduce dedicated test sets to better estimate the true generalization error.  By using the entire dataset for grid search, we are likely underestimating the true prediction error [1]. \n",

Removing outliers increases my confidence in a model because the model is less likely to learn noise in the data created by outliers.  Removing outliers also increases my confidence to estimate the prediction error of my model.\n",
